 -- CONCLUSION
 âœ… Project Completed â€“ SQL EDA on Music/Media Listening Data ðŸŽµðŸ“Š

Alhamdulillah, I successfully performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Music/Media Listening dataset using SQL.
This project focused on understanding user demographics, listening patterns, engagement levels, and genre preferences.

Key highlights:

ðŸ“Œ Analyzed age distribution and top streaming services used.

ðŸ“Œ Explored average listening duration by age group and platforms.

ðŸ“Œ Identified unique listeners and highly engaged users.

ðŸ“Œ Discovered most popular music genres and age-based genre trends.


This project strengthened my SQL skills, particularly in data aggregation, grouping, filtering, and deriving meaningful insights for real-world media data analysis.
